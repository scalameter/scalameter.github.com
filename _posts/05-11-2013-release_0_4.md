title: Released ScalaMeter 0.4 for Scala 2.10

ScalaMeter 0.4 for Scala 2.10 is now available on maven central!

The centerpiece of this release is HTML reporter based on the D3 visualization library. You can see a live example of the [report page here](http://chara.epfl.ch/~prokopec/example/tmp/report/). This new HTML reporter is the default reporter used in `PerformanceTest.Regression` tests.

Some of its features are:

* x-axis choice for composed generators – allows choosing whether problem size, parallelism level or the measurement date are on the x-axis
* chart and histogram view of the measurements
* confidence interval display
* filtering input parameters interactively
* choosing tests from different test groups interactively
* permalinks that allow sharing the chosen configuration of displayed test groups and input parameters

Other new features include:

* [`MemoryFootprint`](http://scalameter.github.io/home/gettingstarted/0.4/executors/) measurer allows measuring the memory footprint of a data structure
* [`-CscopeFilter`](http://scalameter.github.io/home/gettingstarted/0.4/sbt/) option allows selectively running only specific tests from your suite
* time units now added to regression and logging reporters
* the [`include` statement](http://scalameter.github.io/home/gettingstarted/0.4/configuration/) for composing several test classes is now more powerful –- the enclosing class overrides the persistor and reporter values of the nested test classes, but those tests still use their own executors

To get scalameter with Maven:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.github.axel22</groupId>
      <artifactId>scalameter_2.10</artifactId>
      <version>0.4</version>
    </dependency>

Or, in SBT:

    libraryDependencies += "com.github.axel22" %% "scalameter" % "0.4"
    testFrameworks += new TestFramework("org.scalameter.ScalaMeterFramework")

A big thank you to everyone who contributed ideas and/or code to the scalameter repo!
