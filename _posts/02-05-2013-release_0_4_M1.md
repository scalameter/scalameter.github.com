ScalaMeter 0.4-M1 for Scala 2.10.0 has just been released!

New features and fixes:
- the new interactive HTML reporter allows filtering, visualizing and comparing your performance data from your browser much more efficiently than before -- it is now the default reporter for PerformanceTest.Regression tests (description and usage coming soon)
- [`MemoryFootprint`](/home/gettingstarted/0.4/executors/) measurer allows measuring the memory footprint of a data structure
- [`-CscopeFilter`](/home/gettingstarted/0.4/sbt/) option allows selectively running only specific tests from your suite
- the [`include`](/home/gettingstarted/0.4/configuration/) statement for composing several test classes is now more powerful -- the enclosing class overrides the `persistor` and `reporter` values of the nested test classes, but those tests still use their own `executor`s
- time units now added to regression and logging reporters
- other fixes

You can add it as an SBT dependency at Sonatype OSS.

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.github.axel22</groupId>
      <artifactId>scalameter_2.10</artifactId>
      <version>0.4-M1</version>
    </dependency>

Or, in SBT:

    resolvers += "Sonatype OSS Snapshots" at
      "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"

    libraryDependencies += "com.github.axel22" %% "scalameter" % "0.4-M1"
